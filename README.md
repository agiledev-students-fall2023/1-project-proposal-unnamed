# Project Proposal
### Project Title

NYU Shuttle

### What and Why?

The "NYU Shuttle" project aims to develop an alternative frontend for the existing PassioGO system (nyu.passiogo.com) to address several issues that currently hinder its usability and efficiency. The primary concerns include inaccurate scheduling information, inaccurate stop registrations, and the difficulty in incorporating PassioGO's routes into navigation planning. By addressing these issues, we aim to enhance the user experience by providing accurate, real-time information and flexible navigation options that take into account various transportation means, thereby saving time and reducing costs for the NYU community.

### For Whom?

The end-users of this software will be the members of the NYU community who want to utilize the NYU shuttle service for transportation. By offering a more user-friendly and efficient alternative to the current system, we aim to facilitate easier navigation around New York, helping users to find the most convenient routes and to plan their journeys more effectively.

### How?

From an end-user's perspective, the system would offer a range of functionalities including but not limited to:

- Real-time updates on shuttle schedules, incorporating information from various NYU notifications and Google documents to provide the most current data.
- Accurate reflection of temporary stops to avoid confusion and inconvenience.
- An integrated navigation planning tool that allows users to find the best routes by combining NYU shuttle services with other transportation means, offering suggestions on the nearest stops, estimated time of arrival, and potential cost savings.
- A user-friendly interface with easy access to all features, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free user experience.
- Feedback and reporting feature where users can report issues or provide suggestions for further improvements.

### Scope

Depending on how the project is developed, it may necessitate the creation of a wrapper around the existing PassioGO system to facilitate enhanced functionalities. Key development tasks could include devising a feature that monitors and parses information from scattered Google documents, integrating with map navigation APIs to offer real-time route planning and optimization, and crafting a user-friendly interface to ensure a seamless user experience. While the project is indeed ambitious, it remains feasible for a dedicated team of 4-6 computer science students over the course of a semester.
